# SAT-Solver

Performs the following three tasks in order:
1. Given an instance of 2SAT, returns a valid assignment if one exists
2. Given an instance of 3SAT, uses the STAND algorithm to simplify the expression as much as possible.
3. Given an instance of 3SAT, uses the recursive 7-alg to return a valid assignment if one exists.

Clauses should be separated by semicolons, and variables within clauses should be separated by commas. Negation should be indicated with a '-' sign before variable.
